# This file answers question regarding LAB: Testing Objects.

# 1. Printing an object shows  className@hashcode because Java falls back to a default Object.
# 2. Things in Java that begin with a capital letter are reference types, whereas a primitive type is a built-in value.
# 3. Constructors change the initalizaiton story compared to Part B by giving an error, when the default constructor is removed. A default constructor is required for the class and objects to work correclty.
# 4. Adding @Override to toString() is important because it ensures that you're utilizing this, and skips over other parts of the file.
# 5. Utilizing private fields with getters/setters over public fields is better because it is standardized in Java, and it is also more secure than using public fields.
